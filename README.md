This project aims to analyze crime rates and patterns across different regions, utilizing data science techniques to gain insights into crime trends. 
By applying statistical and machine learning models, this project helps identify key factors influencing crime rates and predicts future trends. 
The analysis is presented through visualizations and detailed reports, offering valuable insights for law enforcement and policymakers to strategize 
preventive measures.

Key technologies used in this project include Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn. 
The dataset was preprocessed and cleaned to handle missing data, and various models like linear regression and decision trees were tested 
for predicting crime rates. The findings provided meaningful insights into crime hotspots, seasonal trends, and influential socio-economic factors.
